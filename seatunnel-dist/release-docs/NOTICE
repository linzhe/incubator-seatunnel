- GNU General Public License (GPL - Version 2, June 1991) with the "Classpath Exception"

* The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
*
* Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin Street,
* Fifth Floor Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
*
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
* license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*
* Preamble
*
* The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
* share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
* intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
* make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
* License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
* to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
* Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
* Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
*
* When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
* Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
* freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
* service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
* want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
* free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
*
* To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
* to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
* restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
* distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
*
* For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
* or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
* You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
* And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
*
* We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
* (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
* distribute and/or modify the software.
*
* Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
* that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
* software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
* want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
* that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
* authors' reputations.
*
* Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
* We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
* individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
* proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
* be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
*
* The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
* modification follow.
*
* TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
*
* 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
* notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
* the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
* to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
* either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
* to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
* verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
* (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
* "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
*
* Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
* covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
* the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
* covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
* (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
* is true depends on what the Program does.
*
* 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
* code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
* and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
* and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
* this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
* recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
*
* You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
* you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
*
* 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
* it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
* such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
* that you also meet all of these conditions:
*
*     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
*     that you changed the files and the date of any change.
*
*     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole
*     or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,
*     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
*     terms of this License.
*
*     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
*     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in
*     the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
*     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
*     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
*     redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
*     how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
*     interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
*     based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
*
* These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
* identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
* can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
* themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
* sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
* distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
* the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
* License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
* whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
*
* Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
* your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
* exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
* collective works based on the Program.
*
* In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
* with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
* storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
* scope of this License.
*
* 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
* Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections
* 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
*
*     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
*     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
*     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
*
*     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
*     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
*     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
*     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
*     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
*
*     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
*     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
*     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
*     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
*     Subsection b above.)
*
* The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
* making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
* means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
* associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
* compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
* exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
* normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
* components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
* which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
* executable.
*
* If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
* to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
* the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
* code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
* along with the object code.
*
* 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
* except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
* to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
* automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
* who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
* not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
* full compliance.
*
* 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
* signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
* distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
* prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
* modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
* Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
* its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
* Program or works based on it.
*
* 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
* Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
* original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
* these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
* on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
* responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
*
* 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
* infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
* conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
* otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
* excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
* so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
* any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
* distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
* not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
* receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
* could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
* distribution of the Program.
*
* If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
* any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
* apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
* circumstances.
*
* It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
* patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
* such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
* integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
* by public license practices. Many people have made generous
* contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
* system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
* the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
* software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
* choice.
*
* This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
* a consequence of the rest of this License.
*
* 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
* certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
* original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
* add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
* countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
* not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
* limitation as if written in the body of this License.
*
* 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
* of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
* be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
* address new problems or concerns.
*
* Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
* specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
* later version", you have the option of following the terms and
* conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
* the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
* number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
* Free Software Foundation.
*
* 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
* programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
* author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
* Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
* sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
* two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
* software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
*
* NO WARRANTY
*
* 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
* FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
* OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
* PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
* EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
* WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
* ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
* YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
* NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
*
* 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
* WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
* AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
* DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
* DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
* (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
* INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
* THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
* OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
*
* END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
*
* How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
*
* If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
* possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
* free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
* terms.
*
* To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
* attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
* the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
* "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
*
*     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
*     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
*
*     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
*     under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
*     Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your
*     option) any later version.
*
*     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
*     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
*     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
*     Public License for more details.
*
*     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
*     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,
*     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
*
* Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
*
* If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
* when it starts in an interactive mode:
*
*     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision
*     comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is
*     free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
*     conditions; type `show c' for details.
*
* The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
* appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
* you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
* could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
*
* You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
* school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
* necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
*
*     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
*     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
*
*     signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
*     Ty Coon, President of Vice
*
* This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
* into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
* may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
* with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
* General Public License instead of this License.
*
*
*
* "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2
*
* Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates
* are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,
* based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the
* GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the
* particular source file's header the words "Oracle designates this particular
* file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the
* LICENSE file that accompanied this code."
*   You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in
* this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses
* deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.
* For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License,
* Version 2.0.  Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.
*   Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the
* Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you
* to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed
* under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would not permit you to commingle
* code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for
* example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's
* GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.  Additionally, if you
* were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it
* applies and distribute the result, you would likely be required to license
* some or all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well,
* and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
* included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath Exception could
* therefore effectively compromise your ability to further distribute the package.
*
* Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer
* skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or
* making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed
* and/or involve the use of third party software.
*
* CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
* Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
* combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
* General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.
*
* As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
* permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
* executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and
* to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
* provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
* conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
* which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library,
* you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
* obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
* statement from your version.

* Written by Doug Lea with assistance from members of JCP JSR-166
* Expert Group and released to the public domain, as explained at
* http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
*
* Creative Commons Legal Code
*
* CC0 1.0 Universal
*
*    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE
*    LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
*    ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
*    INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

*    PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
*    THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
*    HEREUNDER.
*
* Statement of Purpose
*
* The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
* exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
* and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
* authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
*
* Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
* the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
* scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
* of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
* works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
* and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
* These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
* culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
* works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
* part through the use and efforts of others.
*
* For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
* expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
* associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
* is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
* elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
* terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
* Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
*
* 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
* protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
* Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
* limited to, the following:
*
*   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
*      communicate, and translate a Work;
*  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
* iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
*      likeness depicted in a Work;
*  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
*      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
*   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
*      in a Work;
*  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
*      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
*      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
*      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
*      directive); and
* vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
*      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
*      implementations thereof.
*
* 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
* of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
* irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
* Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
* of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
* future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
* worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
* treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
* medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
* including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
* purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
* member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
* successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
* revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
* equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
* as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
*
* 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
* be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
* Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
* account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
* extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
* person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
* irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
* Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
* maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
* time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
* of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
* limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
* "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
* applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
* reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
* partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
* of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
* will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
* Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
* action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
* express Statement of Purpose.
*
* 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
*
* a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
*    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
* b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
*    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
*    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
*    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
*    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
*    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
*    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
* c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
*    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
*    limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
*    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
*    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the

*
*      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
*      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
*      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
*      and conversions to other media types.
*
*      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
*      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
*      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
*      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
*
*      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
*      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
*      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
*      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
*      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
*      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
*      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
*
*      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
*      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
*      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
*      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
*      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
*      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

*
*      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
*      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
*      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
*
*   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
*      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
*      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
*      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
*      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
*      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
*
*   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
*      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

*      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
*      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

*      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
*      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
*      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
*      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
*      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
*      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
*      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
*      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
*      as of the date such litigation is filed.
*
*   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
*      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
*      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
*      meet the following conditions:
*
*      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
*          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
*
*      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
*          stating that You changed the files; and
*
*      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
*          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
*          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
*          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
*          the Derivative Works; and
*
*      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
*          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
*          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
*          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
*          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
*          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
*          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
*          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
*          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
*          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
*          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
*          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
*          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
*          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
*          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
*          as modifying the License.
*
*      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
*      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
*      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
*      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
*      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
*      the conditions stated in this License.
*
*   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
*      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
*      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
*      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
*      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
*      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
*      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
*
*   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
*      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
*      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
*      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
*
*   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
*      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
*      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
*      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
*      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
*      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
*      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
*      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
*      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
*
*   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
*      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
*      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
*      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
*      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
*      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
*      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
*      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
*      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
*      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
*      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
*
*   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
*      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
*      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
*      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
*      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
*      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
*      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
*      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
*      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
*      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
*
*   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
*
*   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
